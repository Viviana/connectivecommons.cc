# Viviana Pottery: Grace and Faith

I began my pottery journey as I embraced motherhood. It empowers me to transcend the roles of being both a mother and an academic. This marks the commencement of a therapeutic and uplifting journey. Credit to my classmates and teachers, Joy Friedman, Evelyn Snyder, and Cynthia Consentino, whose inspiration and ceramic expertise have profoundly influenced and guided me on this path.

Inspired by a floral theme, my ceramic works have undergone a meticulous process: wedging, throwing, hand building, drying, trimming, piercing, bisque firing, glazing, and the final firing. This process demands extreme attentiveness to detail and patienceâ€”much like the experience of being an academicâ€”yet it's so immersive that you easily lose track of time and self, leaving no room for mind-boggling reviews. ðŸ™‚

Personally, pottery symbolizes a continuous process of transformation (Jeremiah 1:10). Each piece represents a trajectory of new possibilities, renewal, and hope, serving as a reminder that even amidst chaos and brokenness, our lives can be uplifted, transformed, and elevated to a place of grace, freedom, and fullness. 

<i> Yet you, Lord, are our Father. We are the clay, you are the potter; we are all the work of your hand. (Isaiah 64:8) </i>

Stroke marks were made on the inside of the bowl and it was sprayed with spodumene, resulting in a light and matte color and a delicate, tactile sensation akin to the lightness of a feather."
