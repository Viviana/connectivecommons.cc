* **Examining the Landscape of Community Foundations in the U.S.**  
This project gathers an original nation-wide dataset that identifies the service areas of community foundations, addressing a major limitation found in prior studies that primarily measure physical presence. I presented a community assessment model and empirical evidence of what might promote and inhibit the occurrence of community philanthropic efforts. This project results in [this publication](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s11266-019-00180-x.pdf).

*  **The ‘Matthew Effect’ in Generosity: Examining the Impact on Nonprofit Capacity Across Place and Time** 
This project examines the “philanthropic gap” across the US, with a particular focus on how nonprofits that serve disadvantaged communities are affected. At the end, we will offer recommendations for nonprofit and policy leaders on how to how to foster philanthropy and how to use that philanthropic giving to support a healthy nonprofit sector that promotes volunteering, political participation, services, and programs to serve community needs.
