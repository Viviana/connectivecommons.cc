# Research

My research program is interwoven with three core themes–the 3Cs: **Community, Collective and Connective**. In summary, I combine mixed methods and computational approaches to examine the roles and capacities of nonprofit, philanthropic and grassroots organizations to advance public problem solving online and offline. 

* **Community-oriented**: Looking at both online and offline communities, my research uses a place-based perspective in understanding resource inequality across geographical communities, and how the nonprofit sector shapes and is being shaped by place itself. In the online playing field, I examine online communities on social media and other online platforms where the public, stakeholders and policymakers interact and engage to advance local wellbeing and policy process.

* **Collective-focused**: The unit of analysis of my research is the bottom-up collective “self-governing” phenomenon in which people come together for common good to address local and public problems through organized organizations such as community foundations, nonprofits, grassroots groups [(Lohmann, 1992)](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/089976409202100308?casa_token=Qo-25JS7Hd8AAAAA:Bn8sVo2IwKZVLJZG4_KaPUROHv-JT0RGnZ_NzWjK1UDp1sdA1boPQ-jTtQvjOCev6xOnLvgRLKFk).

* **Connective-driven**: I look at their roles and capacities to make meaningful connections and online [connective actions](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/1369118X.2012.670661?casa_token=4gvQS7S8IGYAAAAA:loshlKFSEc5460Zj3dVVKBj1xC1fYhfiKs8F--7BHsQC3pT85GPgWTE0d_nMq0aQRhH3l9uEjSSF), such as engaging with local communities, social media advocacy, building diffused networks for advancing policy reforms.


## Current Projects

* **The Effect of Place-based Inequality on Philanthropic Capacity**  
Drawing on Pierre Bourdieu's perspective, this project explores the extent to which place-based inequality explains the differing philanthropic capacity of community foundations. Based on data from 2,177 serving counties of 943 community foundations across the U.S., we found that community foundations experience a place dilemma: How much they can fundraise are bounded by the amount of local resources, and concurrently, by the degree of local inequality within the communities. 

*  **The ‘Matthew Effect’ in Generosity: Examining the Impact on Nonprofit Capacity Across Place and Time**  
This project examines the “philanthropic gap” across the US, with a particular focus on how nonprofits that serve disadvantaged communities are affected. At the end, we will offer recommendations for nonprofit and policy leaders on how to how to foster philanthropy and how to use that philanthropic giving to support a healthy nonprofit sector that promotes volunteering, political participation, services, and programs to serve community needs.

* **Donor Influence and Public Engagement**

Wu, V. C. S. (2022, in press). Exploring donor influence and public engagement: Computational and thematic analyses of social media messages. VOLUNTAS: International Journal of Voluntary and Nonprofit Organizations. [ Paper ]

Abstract 
How might donor influence shape the ways community foundations engage with public constituents? Using donor-advised funds to proxy for donor influence, I combined content analysis and structural topic modeling to analyze the themes of 4,055 public engagement messages sent by community foundations on Twitter. The structural topic model results revealed that donor influence significantly varied the themes of public engagement tweets. Strong donor influence was significantly correlated with greater use of policy advocacy and public education messages but negatively correlated with public mobilization and dialogic messages. This study contributes to a growing line of research on donor control and provides important insights into the power dynamics among the triad of 212 community constituents, donors, and foundations.

* **MADE Framework: Understanding Public Engagement of Philanthropic Foundations on Social Media**

Wu, V. C. S. (2021, in press). Beyond policy patrons: A ‘MADE’ framework for examining public engagement efforts of philanthropic foundations on Twitter. Public Management Review. [ Paper ] 

Abstract
This study conceptualises four mechanisms—Mobilisation, Advocacy, Dialogue, and Education ('MADE')—through which foundation actors engage the public on Twitter. We analysed stakeholders targeted and message contents of more than 16,000 tweets collected from 299 Twitter accounts of U.S. community foundations during two 12-month periods. We found evidence that foundations tend to serve as 'a knowledge hub' to educate the public. Notably, the 2020 sample suggests lessened dialogic messages yet increased mobilisation and advocacy messages amid the COVID-19 pandemic and political movements. This study reveals foundations’ intermediary and shifting roles in engaging the public in times of normalcy and crisis.

* **Conceptualizing "Community Leadership"**   
Community philanthropic organizations are increasingly looked to as community leaders that coalesce money, people, knowledge, and networks for addressing public problems at the local level. However, the field remains difficult to grasp—what it is and how it is realized in practice. This project aims to formulate a multi-dimensional conceptual framework to construe community leadership. This study now appears in [this publication](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/nml.21467?casa_token=EKNB8CtSQS8AAAAA:WIbFa9LM6hho4ecxsf64UxrpLIoT7v8rKdFkCVjab5sS7Qat-_1f3EhIZUjsU74zO5pwMeW1k0tco1I).

Abstract
Community foundations are increasingly looked to as community leaders that coalesce money, people, knowledge, and networks for addressing public problems at the local level. However, the field remains difficult to grasp—what it is and how it materializes in practice. Drawing from both academic and practitioner literature, this article proposes a multidimensional conceptual framework that construes community leadership in six capacities ranging from (a) strategizing, (b) convening, (c) knowledge building, (d) capacity building, (e) partnering, to (f) policy engagement. I applied this conceptual framework to analyze 539 annual reports of U.S. community foundations using semi‐automated content analysis. The empirical analysis shows that they tend to specialize in one or a few leadership capacities, but not necessarily all six components. In particular, the capability approach to community leadership through capacity building, partnering, and policy engagement is more favorable among community foundations than a participatory approach through convening and knowledge building. This article contributes to building the conceptual foundation and provides preliminary evidence to advance future research on the foundations' role in community leadership.

* **Examining the Landscape of Community Foundations in the U.S.**   
This project gathers an original nation-wide dataset that identifies the service areas of community foundations, addressing a major limitation found in prior studies that primarily measure physical presence. I presented a community assessment model and empirical evidence of what might promote and inhibit the occurrence of community philanthropic efforts. This project results in [this publication](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s11266-019-00180-x.pdf).

Abstract
Community foundations exemplify a growing form of place-based philanthropic efforts for addressing public problems. However, why do such efforts occur in some places, but not in others? Using an original population dataset of community foundations that combines community characteristics with service area data across 3130 US counties, the empirical analyses of hurdle negative binomial models reveal distinct patterns in explaining their locational distribution and philanthropic activities. Community foundations tend to emerge or flourish in urban communities which are White-dominant, ethnically homogeneous, and less religious but have more social and human capital. Crossing the zero hurdle, their philanthropic activities tend to bloom in ethnically diverse and unequal communities but plummet in highly educated communities with more high-income earners, whereas rural and vulnerable communities with high proportions of residents who are young, old, unemployed, and disabled exemplify potential service gaps of community foundations associated with their rarity and/or fewer philanthropic activities. This study presents a community assessment model and empirical evidence of what might promote and inhibit the occurrence of community philanthropic efforts.
