# Research
My research combines mixed methods and computational approaches to examine the roles and capacities of nonprofit, philanthropic and grassroots organizations to advance public problem solving online and offline. My research program is interwoven with three core themes–the 3Cs: Community, Commons and Connective.

**Community-oriented**: Looking at both online and offline communities, my research uses a place-based perspective in understanding resource inequality across geographical communities, and how the nonprofit sector shapes and is being shaped by place itself. In the online playing field, I examine online communities on social media and other online platforms where the public, stakeholders and policymakers interact and engage to advance local wellbeing and policy process.

**Commons-focused**: The unit of analysis of my research is the bottom-up “self-governing” phenomenon in which people come together for common good or to some extent address local and public problems through philanthropy, nonprofits, grassroots groups and online networks.

**Connective-driven**: I look at their roles and capacities to make meaningful connections, such as engaging with local communities, leading across sectors, building diffused networks for connective actions, and playing a mediating role to advance policy reforms.
