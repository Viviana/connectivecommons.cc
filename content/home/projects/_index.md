# Research
My research combines mixed methods and computational approaches to examine the roles and capacities of nonprofit, philanthropic and grassroots organizations to advance public problem solving online and offline. My research program is interwoven with three core themes–the 3Cs: **Community, Commons and Connective**.

* **Community-oriented**: Looking at both online and offline communities, my research uses a place-based perspective in understanding resource inequality across geographical communities, and how the nonprofit sector shapes and is being shaped by place itself. In the online playing field, I examine online communities on social media and other online platforms where the public, stakeholders and policymakers interact and engage to advance local wellbeing and policy process.

* **Commons-focused**: The unit of analysis of my research is the bottom-up “self-governing” phenomenon in which people come together for common good or to some extent address local and public problems through philanthropy, nonprofits, grassroots groups and online networks.

* **Connective-driven**: I look at their roles and capacities to make meaningful connections, such as engaging with local communities, leading across sectors, building diffused networks for connective actions, and playing a mediating role to advance policy reforms.


# Research Projects

* **The Effect of Place-based Inequality on Philanthropic Capacity**
Drawing on Pierre Bourdieu's perspective, this project explores the extent to which place-based inequality explain the differing philanthropic capacity of community foundations. Based on data from 2,177 serving counties of 943 community foundations across the U.S., we found that community foundations experience a place dilemma: How much they can fundraise are bounded by the amount of local resources, and concurrently, by the degree of local inequality within the communities. 

* **Conceptualizing "Community Leadership"**
Community philanthropic organizations are increasingly looked to as community leaders that coalesce money, people, knowledge, and networks for addressing public problems at the local level. However, the field remains difficult to grasp—what it is and how it is realized in practice. This project aims to formulate a multi-dimensional conceptual framework to construe community leadership.

* **Examining the Landscape of Community Foundations in the U.S.**  
This project gathers an original nation-wide dataset that identifies the service areas of community foundations, addressing a major limitation found in prior studies that primarily measure physical presence. I presented a community assessment model and empirical evidence of what might promote and inhibit the occurrence of community philanthropic efforts. This project results in [this publication](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s11266-019-00180-x.pdf).

*  **The ‘Matthew Effect’ in Generosity: Examining the Impact on Nonprofit Capacity Across Place and Time** 
This project examines the “philanthropic gap” across the US, with a particular focus on how nonprofits that serve disadvantaged communities are affected. At the end, we will offer recommendations for nonprofit and policy leaders on how to how to foster philanthropy and how to use that philanthropic giving to support a healthy nonprofit sector that promotes volunteering, political participation, services, and programs to serve community needs.
